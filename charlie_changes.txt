Summary of changes to the main branch:

- made sure all tests work (will have to run again after making other changes below)
- organized files into folders
- Game class now takes in strategies instead of player
- converted imports to ES6
- made all imports related to ships dependent on allShips instead of the individual ship classes

Still to do:

- run tests/randomStratTest.js
    - when I run it, after 350000 games, I get an error that basically says we don't have enough space to run the game for 5 minutes ("FATAL ERROR: Reached heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory")
- get rid of initialShips
- rearrange game file so methods are in order of use
- make sure simpleBoard is fully/correctly implemented
- add all of maia's comments
- update UI
    - make game look better (because now we'll have multiple ships in one coord, which don't all show up currently)
    - make logs update on time (instead of 1 or more turns late)
