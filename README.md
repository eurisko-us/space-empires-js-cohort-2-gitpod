## How to run a game
- node.js file is where the game will be run unless you are doing tests
- game class requires clientSockets, players, and initialShips as inputs
  - If you are running node app.js, clientSockets is already defined in the file. If you are writing tests, put null for the clientSockets input
  - players is a list of 2 players, which each require a strategy as an input
  - initialShips is a dictionary {"Ship name": Number of this type of ship you want}
